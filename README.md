# SEAOCC CA SNOW MAP
The SEAOCC Snow Load Mapping Project is creating an online website that automates the task of determining site specific snow loads in California.
The project invovles determining snow loading criteria for all jurisdictions within California and creating an online map tool that accepts an address as input, and returns the ground snow load as output.
The last status update was presented on August 29th at the 2019 SEAOC Convention in Squaw Valley. Overall process, data collection, and a working website application was shown.
Work is currently being done in data collection, snow load criteria analysis, and website development. A more complete website application is expected to be shown at the 2020 SEAOC Convention.
